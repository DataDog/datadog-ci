Execute commands with Datadog from within your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment scripts. A good way to perform end to end tests of your application before applying your changes or deploying. It currently features running synthetics tests and waiting for the results.

## How to install the CLI

The package is under [@datadog/datadog-ci](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datadog/datadog-ci) and can be installed through NPM or Yarn:

```sh
# NPM
npm install --save-dev @datadog/datadog-ci

# Yarn
yarn add --dev @datadog/datadog-ci
```

If you need `datadog-ci` as a CLI tool instead of a package, you can run it with [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) or install globally:

```sh
# npx
npx @datadog/datadog-ci [command]

# NPM install globally
npm install -g @datadog/datadog-ci

# Yarn v1 add globally
yarn global add @datadog/datadog-ci
```

### Standalone binary (**beta**)

If installing nodejs in the CI is an issue, standalone binaries are provided with [releases](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/releases). Only _linux-x64_, _darwin-x64_ (macOS) and _win-x64_ (Windows) are supported at the time. **These standalone binaries are in _beta_ and their stability is not guaranteed**. To install:

#### Linux

```sh
curl -L --fail "https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/releases/latest/download/datadog-ci_linux-x64" --output "/usr/local/bin/datadog-ci" && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/datadog-ci
```

#### MacOS

```sh
curl -L --fail "https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/releases/latest/download/datadog-ci_darwin-x64" --output "/usr/local/bin/datadog-ci" && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/datadog-ci
```

#### Windows

```sh
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/releases/latest/download/datadog-ci_win-x64.exe" -OutFile "datadog-ci.exe"
```

Then you can run `datadog-ci` commands normally:

```sh
datadog-ci version
```

## Usage

```bash
Usage: datadog-ci <command> <subcommand> [options]

Available commands:
  - lambda
  - sourcemaps
  - synthetics
  - dsyms
  - git-metadata
  - junit
  - trace
```

Each command allows interacting with a product of the Datadog platform. The commands are defined in the [src/commands](/src/commands) folder.

Further documentation for each command can be found in its folder, ie:

- [Lambda](src/commands/lambda)
- [Sourcemaps](src/commands/sourcemaps/)
- [Synthetics CI/CD Testing](src/commands/synthetics/)
- [iOS dSYM Files](src/commands/dsyms/)
- [Git metadata](src/commands/git-metadata)
- [JUnit XML](src/commands/junit)
- [Trace](src/commands/trace)

## Contributing

Pull requests for bug fixes are welcome, but before submitting new features or changes to current functionality [open an issue](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/issues/new)
and discuss your ideas or propose the changes you wish to make. After a resolution is reached a PR can be submitted for review.

### Running command in development environment

When developing the tool it is possible to run commands using `yarn launch`. It relies on `ts-node` so does not need building the project for every new change.

```bash
yarn launch synthetics run-tests --config dev/global.config.json
```

### Framework and libraries used

This tool uses [clipanion](https://github.com/arcanis/clipanion) to handle the different commands.

The tests are written using [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).

The coding style is checked with [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) and the configuration can be found in the [tslint.json](/tslint.json) file.

### Repository structure

Commands are stored in the [src/commands](src/commands) folder.

The skeleton of a command is composed of a README, an `index.ts` and a folder for the tests.

```bash
src/
└── commands/
    └── fakeCommand/
         ├── __tests__/
         │   └── index.test.ts
         ├── README.md
         └── index.ts
```

Documentation of the command must be placed in the README.md file, the [current README](/README.md) must be updated to link to the new command README.

The `index.ts` file must export classes extending the `Command` class of `clipanion`. The commands of all `src/commands/*/index.ts` files will then be imported and made available in the `datadog-ci` tool.

A sample `index.ts` file for a new command would be:

```typescript
import {Command} from 'clipanion'

export class HelloWorldCommand extends Command {
  public async execute() {
    this.context.stdout.write('Hello world!')
  }
}

module.exports = [HelloWorldCommand]
```

Lastly, test files must be created in the `__tests__/` folder. `jest` is used to run the tests and a CI has been set using Github Actions to ensure all tests are passing when merging a Pull Request.

The tests can then be launched through the `yarn test` command, it will find all files with a filename ending in `.test.ts` in the repo and execute them.

### Continuous Integration tests

The CI performs tests to avoid regressions by building the project, running unit tests and running one end-to-end test.

The end-to-end test installs the package in a new project, configures it (using files in the `.github/workflows/e2e` folder) and runs a `synthetics run-tests` command in a Datadog Org (`Synthetics E2E Testing Org`) to verify the command is able to perform a test.

The synthetics tests ran are a browser test (id `neg-qw9-eut`) and an API test (id `v5u-56k-hgk`), both loading a page which outputs the headers of the request and verifying the `X-Fake-Header` header is present. This header is configured as an override in the `.github/workflows/e2e/test.synthetics.json` file. The API and Application keys used by the command are stored in Github Secrets named `datadog_api_key` and `datadog_app_key`.

The goal of this test is to verify the command is able to run tests and wait for their results as expected as well as handling configuration overrides.

### Workflow

```bash
# Compile and watch
yarn watch

# Run the tests
yarn jest

# Build code
yarn build

# Format code
yarn format

# Make bin executable
yarn prepack
```

### Release Process

Releasing a new version of `datadog-ci` unfolds as follow:

- create a new branch for the version upgrade
- update the version using `yarn version [--patch|--minor|--major]` depending on the nature of the changes introduced. You may refer to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/#summary) to determine which to increment.
- push the branch along with the tag to the upstream (Github), create a Pull Request with the changes introduced detailed in the description and get at least one approval. ([sample Pull Request](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/pull/78))
- merge the Pull Request
- create a Github Release from the [Tags page](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/tags) with the description of changes introduced
- Once the release has been created, a Github Action will publish the package

### Pre-Release Process

If you need to create a pre-release or releasing in a different channel here's how it works:

- create a new branch for the channel you want to release to (`alpha`, `beta`, ...).
- create a PR for your feature branch with the channel branch as a base.
- pick a version following this format `version-channel`, it can be `0.10.9-alpha` or `1-beta`...
- update the `version` field in `package.json`
- merge the Pull Request
- create a [Github Release](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/releases/new?target=alpha&tag=0.10.9-alpha&prerelease=1&title=Alpha+prerelease):
  - target the channel branch
  - pick a tag based on your version `version-channel`
  - check the `This is a pre-release` checkbox
- publish the release and an action will publish it on npm
