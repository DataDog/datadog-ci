# trace command

Trace a command with a custom span and report it to Datadog.

## Usage

```bash
datadog-ci trace [--no-fail] [--name <name>] -- <command>
```

For example:

```bash
datadog-ci trace --name "Say Hello" -- echo "Hello World"
```

- The positional arguments are the command which will be launched and traced.
- `--name` (default: same as <command>) is a human-friendly name for the reported span.
- `--no-fail` (default: `false`) will prevent the trace command from failing even when not run in a supported CI Provider. In this case, the command will be launched and nothing will be reported to Datadog.

#### Environment variables

Additionally you might configure the `trace` command with environment variables:

- `DD_API_KEY` (**required**): API key used to authenticate the requests.
- `DD_ENV`: you may choose the environment you want your test results to appear in.
- `DD_TAGS`: set global tags applied to all spans. The format must be `key1:value1,key2:value2`.
- `DD_SITE`: choose your Datadog site, e.g. datadoghq.com or datadoghq.eu.

### Optional dependencies

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is used for extracting repository metadata.

### End-to-end testing process

To verify this command works as expected, you can trace a mock command and validate the command returns 0:

```bash
export DD_API_KEY='<API key>'
export CIRCLECI=true

yarn launch trace --name "Say Hello" echo "Hello World"
```

Successful output should look like this:

```bash
Hello World
```
