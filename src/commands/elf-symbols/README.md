## Overview

Upload Elf debug info files to Datadog to symbolicate your profiles.

**This command requires `objcopy` from binutils package.**

## Setup

You need to have `DD_API_KEY` in your environment.

```bash
# Environment setup
export DD_API_KEY="<API KEY>"
```

You can configure the tool to use Datadog EU by defining the `DD_SITE` environment variable as `datadoghq.eu`. By default, the requests are sent to Datadog US.

To make these variables available, Datadog recommends setting them in an encrypted `datadog-ci.json` file at the root of your project:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "<API_KEY>",
  "datadogSite": "<SITE>"
}
```

To override the full URL for the intake endpoint, define the `DATADOG_SOURCEMAP_INTAKE_URL` environment variable.

## Commands

### `upload`

**Warning:** The `elf-symbols upload` command is in beta. It requires you to set `DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED=1`.

This command will upload debug info from Elf files to Datadog in order to symbolicate your application's profiles.

Run the following command to upload all the necessary files:

```bash
DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED=1 datadog-ci elf-symbols upload ~/your/build/bin/
```

If location is a directory, command will scan it recursively looking for Elf files, and for each Elf file, it will split the debug infos and upload it to Datadog.
If location is a file, command will split debug info from it and upload them to Datadog.

| Parameter | Condition | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Optional | Run the command without the final step of uploading. All other checks are performed. |
| `--max-concurrency` | Optional | The number of concurrent uploads to the API. Defaults to 20. |
| `--disable-git`    | Optional | Prevents the command from invoking Git in the current working directory and sending repository-related data to Datadog (such as the hash, remote URL, and paths within the repository of sources referenced in the source map). |
| `--repository-url` | Optional | Overrides the remote repository with a custom URL. For example, `https://github.com/my-company/my-project`. |
| `--replace-existing` | Optional | If symbol information with the same build ID is already present on Datadog side, discard it and use the newly uploaded information.<br>Default behavior is to only replace existing debug information if the newly uploaded information is considered a better source with the following ordering: debug info > symbol table > dynamic symbol table. |
| `--upload-dynamic-symbols` | Optional | Upload dynamic symbol information if neither debug information nor symbol table are present but a dynamic symbol table is available.<br>Default behavior is to upload symbol information only when a symbol table or debug information are present, since dynamic symbol table has less information and only contains exported symbols.  |
