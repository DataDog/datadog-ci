# Commit command

**Access to this command is currently restricted.**

Upload the git commit details to Datadog.

## Usage

### Setup

You need to have `DATADOG_API_KEY` in your environment.

```bash
# Environment setup
export DATADOG_API_KEY="<API KEY>"
```

It is possible to configure the tool to use Datadog EU by defining the `DATADOG_SITE` environment variable to `datadoghq.eu`. By defaut the requests are sent to Datadog US.

It is also possible to override the full URL for the intake endpoint by defining the `DATADOG_SOURCEMAP_INTAKE_URL` environment variable.

### Commands

#### `upload`

This command will upload the current commit details to Datadog in order to create links to your repositories inside DataDog's UI.

This command should be run inside a local git repository and the git program must be available:

```bash
datadog-ci commit upload
```

* `--repository-url` (default: empty): overrides the repository remote with a custom URL. For example: https://github.com/my-company/my-project

#### Limitations

The repository URL is infered from the remote named `origin` (or the first remote if none are named `origin`). The value can be overriden by using the `--repository-url` flag.
For example: The remote `git@github.com:DataDog/example.git` will create links that point to `https://github.com/DataDog/example`.

The only repository URLs supported are the ones whose host contains: `github`, `gitlab` or `bitbucket`. This allows DataDog to create proper URLs such as:

| Provider  | URL |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub / GitLab  | https://\<repository-url\>/blob/\<commit-hash\>/\<tracked-file-path\>#L\<line\> |
| Bitbucket | https://\<repository-url\>/src/\<commit-hash\>/\<tracked-file-path\>#lines-\<line\>  |

### End-to-end testing process

To verify this command works as expected, you can trigger a test run and verify it returns 0:

```bash
export DATADOG_API_KEY='<API key>'

yarn launch commit upload
```

Successful output should look like this:
```bash
Starting upload.
Uploading
âœ… Uploaded in 1.862 seconds.
```
